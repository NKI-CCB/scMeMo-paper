# scMeMo - single cell Mechanistic Modeler
This repository contains the code and scripts to reproduce the analysis described in the paper "Inferring single-cell protein levels and cell cycle behavior in heterogeneous cell populations".

The manuscript has been submitted as preprint to bioRxiv and will hopefully appear there shortly.

Each directory contains a number of scripts that should be run in sequence. The code uses the BCM3 software package, available at https://github.com/NKI-CCB/bcm3.
